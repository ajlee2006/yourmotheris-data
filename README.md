## UPDATE 22/05/2021
I reset the entire system for a better system where all past entries are stored in one file. The previous words are downloadable at [previousrun.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajlee2006/yourmotheris-data/main/previousrun.zip) 

## [BETA] yourmotheris-data
Data for the 10-minutely Your Mother Is word.

## Accessing data
[current.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajlee2006/yourmotheris-data/main/current.txt) gives JSON data of the latest word. [past.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajlee2006/yourmotheris-data/main/past.txt) is all past words in ascending order.
